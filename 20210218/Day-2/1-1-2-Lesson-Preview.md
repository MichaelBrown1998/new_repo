# 1.1.2 Lesson Preview

## Focus

We cover many new concepts in this lesson. Things such as variables, data types, and operators correspond directly to concepts in arithmetic. An important detail to note here is that things are named deliberately—no one is trying to fool anyone. This practice of naming things properly is a very important concept to grasp and it starts here with the fundamentals.

This lesson lays a foundation of concepts that you will use throughout your career as a software developer. These core concepts are not language-specific, so some of it may already be familiar to you if you've worked with other programming languages.

It is vital that you are not only proficient in using these core concepts, but you should also be able to explain them.

## Approach

We take a bottom-up approach to learning Java. The material starts with the non-object oriented features of the language and gets us writing simple programs as early as possible. We will use variables, expressions, statements, and operators. We need to focus on the fundamentals so we build a solid foundation and develop good, intentional habits.

We will also be using the debugger, an important and powerful tool in every Java developer's tool kit!

## Depth

To help focus your time, here’s how you should prioritize the depth of understanding needed for skills we cover in this lesson:

Enduring Knowledge: These skills, or mindsets, should endure well after finishing the course: 

- Step-wise problem solving and basic logic first
- Write clean code!

Important to Know and Do: It’s important that you can apply these new skills and describe how and why you are applying them:

- Variables
- Data Types
- Java Keywords

Worth Being Familiar With: These skills are worth being familiar with but for the sake of staying on track in the course, the Important and Enduring skills should be prioritized first. This material will be available to you throughout the course and for a period afterward, so you can always come back and revisit these topics in the future. 

- Debugging

## Deliverables

- 1.1.2 Activity: Rectangular Paving Company
- 1.1.2 Activity: Command Line Gram
- 1.1.2 Activity: Luxury Tax Calculator
- 1.1.2 Katas

During this lesson, we’ll be completing a mix of group and individual activities. You should feel confident about this material if:

- You are able to explain what the debugger does
- You are able to use variables and expressions in a program
- You are able to use operators in a program
