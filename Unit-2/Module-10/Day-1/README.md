## Approach
We begin this lesson by identifying the need for security in web applications. We do not want to go too deep here. Our main objective is that the learners are aware of security vulnerabilities possible in web apps and are aware of and able to use tools for staying up-to-date regarding web app security. 

The lesson culminates with a tutorial showing how to control access to a Spring Boot web service using Spring Security authentication and role based access control (authorization). The method put forth in the tutorial should be used for completing assignments and summative assessment.
