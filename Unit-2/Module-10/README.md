## Security and Reliability
Architectural features such as security and reliability are crucial to all web-based applications. This module presents frameworks and techniques for securing, monitoring, and making Java based cloud-native applications more resiliant.

## How This Relates to the Previous Module
The previous modules have focused on the frameworks and techniques used for the implementation of user facing application features without much thought about architectural features such as security and reliability. This module covers frameworks and techniques that can be used to make applications more secure and more resiliant in adverse conditions. 

## Approach
This module starts with an overview of Spring Security and then dives into the authentication and authorization features of the framework. This is followed by coverage of the circuit breaker pattern and the Netflix Hystrix library.

## Design

1. Spring Security
1. OAuth
1. Circuit Breaker Pattern (Netflix Hysterix)
