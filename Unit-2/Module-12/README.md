## HTML, CSS, and JS

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provide the foundation for users to interact with the web. While learners have spent the vast majority of the course in the console, we now move to a more "proper" representation of information using front-end development basics.

## How This Relates to the Previous Module

This module will deviate a bit from previous modules. We will now focus more on how web applications look, and how users will interact with them. The front end includes the content and how it is styled (how it looks). We will cover how to connect the front end to the back end that we built in the previous modules of this course.

## Approach

This module starts with a refresh of HTML, CSS, and basic JS. All of these topics were covered in the pre-work many weeks ago. But we want to make sure that the learners have a solid understanding of JS basics as we prepare them to move into React in the following module.

This module culminates with students building a web interface with a Spring back end.
