# Doggie Day Care

For this activity, you'll write a JavaScript command-line application to manage a doggie day care center. The user is the day care administrator, who can do the following:

* Check a dog in (that is, process a drop-off).

* Check a dog out (that is, process a pickup).

* Display all the dogs in the day care.

## Rules

* The day care can hold only 20 dogs.

* The day care identifies the dogs by name, so we can't add a duplicate. The customer can choose to add a last name or use a nickname to keep the names unique.

* During a pickup, the name comparisons are case insensitive.

## Tasks

1. Create a new JavaScript package/project by using `npm init`.

2. Add a `start` script to `package.json`.

3. Run your code by using `npm start`.

4. Download and install `prompt-sync` by using `npm install`.

5. Exclude `node_modules` from Git by using the `.gitignore` file.

6. Download and install `eslint` as a development dependency.

7. Initialize the ESLint configuration by using `npx eslint --init`.

8. Add an ESLint `pretest` script to `package.json`.

9. Run the `pretest` script to find errors, problems, and suggestions.
