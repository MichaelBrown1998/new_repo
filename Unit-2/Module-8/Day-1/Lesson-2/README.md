# Lesson Overview: Configuration Server
The purpose of this lesson is to show learners how to set up a Spring configuration server and then use that configuration server to externalize the configuration of a Spring Boot based REST web service.

## Topics
1. Purpose
2. Configuration Server Setup
3. Using the Configuration Server

## Assessments
* Random Quote Service (formative)
* Moto Inventory Fix/Enhance (formative)
* Tasker (summative)

## Required Software and Resources
* Java 8
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Postman
* Chrome
* Spring Initializr
* MySQL
* MySQL Workbench

## Approach
The material presents the concept and motivation of the configuration server and then discusses configuration servers in the context of 12-factor app and cloud-native concepts. Learners are then shown how to setup a configuration server and how to use the configuration server in a web service. Learners get three chances to practice these skills:

1. A clean-room implementation of a configuration server and a web service that uses the configuration server.
2. Modifications and enhancements to an existing web service. One of the enhancements is modifiying the web service to use a configuration service.
3. A summative assessment that entails modifications and enhancements to an existing web service. Again, one of the enhancements is to modify the web service to use a configuration service.
