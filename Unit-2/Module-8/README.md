## Module Overview: Twelve-Factor and Cloud-Native Applications
Unit 2 covers building twelve-factor and cloud-native applications. Applications built using these approaches are more resilient, easier to maintain and deploy, and more scalable than monolithic applications.

## How This Relates to the Previous Module
The web applications and web services in Unit 1 were built using modern frameworks, patterns, and agile development techniques, but they were also monolithic. Most applications start as monoliths because it is difficult to predict what kind of scaling (if any) will be needed as the applications grows. Some applications remain manageable as monoliths; others need to be split into microservices. In both cases, development and operations teams can benefit from using twelve-factor and cloud-native application techniques. 

This module introduces students to twelve-factor and cloud-native application concepts, and microservices. It also covers two key components of twelve-factor applications: configuration servers and service registries.

## Approach
Students are first introduced to the twelve-factor and cloud-native application development paradigm and then are shown four key components of this approach to application development: microservices, configuration servers, service registries, and edge services.

## Design
* Twelve-factor apps, cloud-native apps, and microservices
* Configuration servers
* Service registries
* Edge Services
