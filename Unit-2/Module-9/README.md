## Module Overview: Queues, Edge Services, Caching, and AWS
Queues and caches are important components that can be used in twelve-factor and cloud-native applications. This module introduces students to these components.

## How This Relates to the Previous Module
The previous module introduced twelve-factor and cloud-native applications along with four components of these types of applications. This module continues by introducing two more components (queues  and caches).

## Approach
This module is straightforward. Students are introduced to each component, shown where and why these components are used, and then are shown how to use them.

## Design

1. Asynchronous process with queues
1. Caching
