# Book Project - INCOMPLETE SOLUTION

This project contains code that meets the functional requirements, but not the test requirements.

It is intended to be used as a model (not for testing) for any project that requires a combination of queues and feign clients.

The note service contains integration tests.

The config service and service registry are complete.

The queue consumer is complete.

The book service contains a few service layer tests to show how to set up tests for a service layer that uses a dao, a feign client, and a queue.
